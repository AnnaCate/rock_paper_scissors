## Technology used
HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## Instructions for use
Use your cursor to click one of the buttons: either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The score-keeping area will update with the results of that round. Repeat this process until either you or the computer scores 5 points, which will be the end of the game. A winner will be announced in the score-keeping area.
